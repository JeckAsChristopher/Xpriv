The prebuilt version of this program is only available for Termux and Linux.

Here's why:

- My operating system is **Linux**, and it cannot compile `.exe` (for Windows) or `.pkg` (for macOS).
- The build was done inside **Termux**, which runs on Android but behaves like a standard Linux environment.
- Because of this, the prebuilt binary is a **Linux ELF** file compiled for the **AArch64 (ARM64)** architecture.
- You can still compile on different Operating Systems, Only Prebuild is affected

This means it will work on Termux and other compatible Linux environments, but not on Windows or macOS without recompiling.

Soon i will gather teams that has macos and windows!

Thanks for understanding!
